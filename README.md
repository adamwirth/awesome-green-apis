# WIP --- Awesome Green APIs dashboard code

## TODO List

* Make charts generic
  * Add metadata like "xaxis", "yaxis" to datasets to have them be able to slot in without editing chart code
  * Make opinions about who and where
* More datasets
  * Define data models for other use-cases/verticals
  * Add other example companies', spool up example data using data models
  * Don't fret about folder structure for now, do that and a real DB later
* Make a tabulated landing page per use case, once more datasets/charts created
* Make for a "real" database/redis cache setup, even if its done locally
* Test for data binding and caching with the recharts as I try to reuse chart elements and ingest other data
* Keep adding ideas/thoughts to this list, instead of running down rabbit holes
